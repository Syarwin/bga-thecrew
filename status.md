From MANUAL

The Crew is best when played with a crew of three or more.
Nevertheless, you can also explore the infinite vastness of
outer space with the following mission structure:

1. Put the four rocket card aside.
2. With the rest of the 39 large playing cards, put seven
face down in a row, one next to another. Then put an
additional seven cards face up in a row on the first
seven covered cards.
3. Shuffle the four rocket in with the remaining cards and
distribute these face down and evenly among both of the
crew members, so that each has 13 cards.
4. Each crew member puts a radio communication token
with its green side up in front of himself or herself, as
well as a reminder card.
5. Place the distress signal tokens face down.
6. Shuffle the 36 small task cards and display them as
a face-down stack. Keep the task tokens handy.

Only the face-up cards from JARVIS can be played. when
a face-up card has been played, the card below will be
revealed, but only after the completion of the trick and
not before.
