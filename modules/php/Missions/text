    26 : _('A loud bang interrupts your introspective mood. Two space rocks that were in the vicinity of Saturn have torn holes in your ship’s hull. The on-board analysis module has immediately sealed off the affected storage area. Both rocks are still stuck in the shell of the hull. You must carefully remove them without further increasing the damage done. <b>At least two color cards, each with a value of one, must win one trick each.</b>'),
    27 : _('You determine that the tear in the hull was not without consequences. A review of the modules associated with the area indicates damage to the flux capacitor. Although currently this is not a major problem, repairs will be necessary in the long-run, if you want to make it home. <b>Your commander specifies who should carry out the repair.</b>'),
    28 : _('Readings are indicating an unusually high magnitude of cosmic rays in the area. You continue your flight oblivious, uninterrupted, and unaware that your radio messages are either not transmitting, or arriving with a great deal of time delay. This is not going to make working easy. <b>You are only allowed to communicate from the third trick on.</b> '),
    29 : _('Your communication module appears to have suffered more damage than you initially thought. The repair requires a series of tests and calibrations that you must carry out together and with precision. <b>At no time may a crew member have won two tricks more than another crew member. Communication is down. </b>'),
    30 : _('One part is done, but you postpone the rest of the repairs, as you are heading straight for Uranus. Its smooth, pale blue surface makes it look almost artificial. You tear yourself away from this fascinating view, because there are still repairs to be made. <b>You are only allowed to communicate from the second trick on.</b>'),
    31 : _('As you slowly move away from Uranus, you receive a message from Earth requesting the collection of metadata from the moons of Uranus. Unfortunately, due to the radio interference, it arrived too late, you can only see three of the 27 moons — Rosalind, Belinda, and Puck. That will have to suffice for the time being. '),
    32 : _('In the meantime, despite the favorable conditions, it is obvious how long you have been on the road together and the inevitable human characteristics begin to come to light. In order to avoid a heated conflict, everyone delves into his or her work. <b>Your commander takes over the organization and distributes the individual tasks.<br/>7 tasks</b> '),
    33 : _('A space walk is imminent! One of the hatches is broken and needs to be repaired. But leaving the ship always poses a risk. <b>After everyone has looked at his or her cards, your commander asks about his or her willingness to volunteer. It may only be answered with a “yes” or “no.” Your commander then selects another crew member. The chosen crew member must win exactly one trick, but not with a rocket card. </b>'),
    34 : _('Neptune is already in sight as your ship begins to waver. Man the stabilizers so as not to lose control. In the meantime your commander must realign the gravitation module. <b>At no time may a crew member have won two tricks more than another crew member. In addition, your commander must win the first and last trick. </b>'),
    35 : _('Cautiously you reach the outermost planet of our solar system: the ice giant Neptune. Its deep blue makes you shiver. As you slowly pass Neptune, you receive another message from Earth. The space probe Alpha 5 is orbiting Neptune, but has damaged sensors. Find it and fix them. '),
    36 : _('You take advantage of one of the rare moments of calm to socialize with each other. With all the minor and more major emergencies, the responsibility on your shoulders, and the uncertainty about the outcome of your adventure, tension has built up in every single crew member. So it’s good to just sit together, and talk. Relieved you re-dedicate yourselves to the coming challenges. <b>Your commander distributes the individual tasks. <br/>7 tasks</b>'),
    37 : _('You reach the dwarf planet Pluto. Many years ago it would have been the ninth planet. You take a moment to reminisce about how your very educated mother used to serve you noodles, and talk to you about the planets while you reflect on the changeability of things. Nevertheless, the ship must be kept on course. <b>The commander decides who should take care of it.</b>'),
    38 : _('You reach the heliopause, the border area of our solar system. If the calculations prove correct, the ninth planet cannot be far away. A feeling of excitement spreads, the hour of truth approaches. As your instruments react, you almost jump out of your seats. But unfortunately it is just a false alarm. <b>You are only allowed to communicate from the third trick on. </b>'),
    39 : _('This has to be it! The readings indicated on your modules can only be produced by a truly gigantic object. The effects are so massive that even your <b>radio communication is interrupted</b>. Recalibrate your instruments and find out what’s really going on. '),
    40 : _('You are now paying very close attention to the object, but are still uncertain what it might be. What appears in front of you could be a moon of Pluto. No wait, that’s no moon! You have found it! Planet Nine! Euphoria spreads among you and all the hardships are quickly forgotten. A surface scan of the planet suggests a solid crust. That would mean this is not another gas giant, it’s traversable. A fantastic opportunity is opening up. <b>Before you begin to distribute the task cards, you may move a task token to another task card that currently has no task tokens. Decide together but do not reveal anything about your own cards. </b>'),
    41 : _('You regulate the engines to prepare for landing. Due to the completely new conditions, one of you has to take over the coordination of the landing. <b>After everyone has looked at his or her hand, your commander asks everyone about his or her readiness. It may only be answered with a “yes” or “no.” Your commander then selects another crew member for the task. This crew member’s task is to only win the first and last tricks. Since only the thrusters are used for correcting the position, neither trick may be won with rocket cards.</b>'),
    42 : _('The planet is extremely cold and inhospitable but seems to be habitable. During your investigation you notice an area that appears to be moving away from your instruments. The closer you get to this anomaly, the more blatant the measurement errors become. What this means defies scientific explanation. At least you can narrow in on the phenomenon, because the results normalize when you move away.'),
    43 : _('In the name of science, you venture closer. The gravitational laws seem to invert the closer you get to the anomaly and you need to anchor yourself to the planet’s surface using vibranium hooks for safety. <b>Your commander secures the rest of the crew and distributes the individual tasks.</b> The data you are collecting allows for only one conclusion: You have discovered a wormhole.<b><br/>9 tasks</b> '),
    44 : _('Up until now, wormholes have been at most theoretical constructs and now here you are, standing right in front of one. It overshadows you like a black monolith — incomprehensible, but with a huge attraction. You send a message to Earth and prepare the engines for the jump. <b>Every rocket card must win a trick. First the one rocket card, then the two, the three, and finally the four.</b>'),
    45 : _('The effect is monumental! You are strapped into your seats but feel like you’re everywhere at the same time. Colors and shapes change, and light feels like a swirling mass that behaves like an intelligent being and ensnares you. You focus on your instruments and try not to lose your mind. '),
    46 : _('While you are being assailed with an overwhelming amount of information, you find you are still able to instinctively react to danger. Suddenly the main modules of the ship shut down during the jump, and red warning lights and alarms tear you from of your previously trance-like state. <b>Your task is that the crew member to the left of the member with the pink nine must win all pink cards. Say who has pink nine.</b>'),
    47 : _('You are exhausted, at the end of your rope. The jump feels like a jail now, in which you can no longer distinguish between reality and fantasy. Your body screams that you can barely stand even ten more seconds of this, but your mind questions how long ten seconds actually is. You begin to count them down — and suddenly burst out of the wormhole.'),
    48 : _('You barely have time to orient yourself. It is suddenly extremely hot everywhere. The on-board analysis module instantly shifts the entire ship into the highest danger level. The first of the modules begin to fall victim to the radical temperature fluctuations. Even in your regulated suits, you break into a sweat within seconds. You need to activate the emergency protocol, extend the heat shields, and get away from the heat source as quickly as possible. <b>The Omega task must be won in the last trick. </b>'),
    49 : _('When you finally come to your senses, the situation has almost normalized. You just barely managed to take the necessary steps before you collapsed from exhaustion. Determining your current location you can hardly believe it. You are orbiting Venus! The wormhole is a direct link between Planet Nine and Venus, the second planet. This also explains the extreme heat, because Venus is significantly closer to the Sun than Earth. It takes a moment for the realization to dawn on you: You can go home! Check all ten main modules, focusing on life support, engines, and communication. Set course for Earth.'),
    50 : _('The way back is much more complicated than expected. Some modules have been permanently damaged during the trip and you will have to fight against the immense gravitational pull of the Sun. With your reserves depleted, you cannot allow yourself any mistakes — the voyage home must be executed precisely. You must first take advantage of a gravitational catapult. Then, the ship’s modules must be kept under control and the approach to Earth initiated. In the end, landing on Earth will require no less attention than any other maneuver you’ve performed so far. <b>Everyone looks at his or her cards. A crew member must win the first four tricks. Another crew member has to win the last trick. The remaining crew members must win all the tricks in between. Your commander asks everyone for his or her preferred task, you then decide together as a crew who should assume which role. Do not say anything about your cards. </b>'),
